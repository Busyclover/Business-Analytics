# Business-Analytics

This is one of the continuously updated repositories that documents personal data science journey. Currently, contents are organized into three different repositories based on the following table's description.

| Repository | Documentation Focus |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [machine-learning](https://github.com/ethen8181/machine-learning) | Machine learning in R / python. |
| [Business-Analytics](https://github.com/ethen8181/Business-Analytics) | All the other data analytic related stuffs that are not solely about machine-learning. |
| [programming](https://github.com/ethen8181/programming) | Walking through books / online courses. |

## Statistics

**bandits : 2016.5.7**

Multi-armed bandits algorithms, a possible alternative to ab test in short tests or extremely long tests. For those that are not familiar with bayesian statistics, it's recommended to go through the first two documents in the **bayesian_statistics** folder.

- Epsilon Greedy, Softmax, Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling from scratch. [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/Business-Analytics/blob/master/bandits/bandits.ipynb)]


**ab_tests : 2016.4.22**

More focused on getting famailiar with bayesian ab test. The frequentist ab test is currently extremely sloppy. For those that are not familiar with bayesian statistics, it's recommended to go through the documents in the **bayesian_statistics** folder.

- Template for the iterative AB testing process (not restricted to the bayesian AB testing). [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/Business-Analytics/blob/master/ab_tests/template.ipynb)]
- Bayesian AB testing, beta heirarchical model with *pymc*. [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/Business-Analytics/blob/master/ab_tests/bayesian_ab_test.ipynb)]
- AB testing caveats (not restricted to the bayesian AB testing). [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/Business-Analytics/blob/master/ab_tests/ab_test_caveats.ipynb)]
- Frequentist AB testing. [[R markdown](http://ethen8181.github.io/Business-Analytics/ab_tests/frequentist_ab_test.html)]


**bayesian_statistics : 2016.4.21**

For starters with bayesian statistics, read the documents in listed order.

- Bayes theorem basics. [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/Business-Analytics/blob/master/bayesian_statistics/bayes_basics.ipynb)]
- Beta distribution, empirical bayes estimation, credible interval and false discovery rate. [[R markdown](http://ethen8181.github.io/Business-Analytics/bayesian_statistics/bayes/bayes.html)]
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) - Metropolis Hastings Algorithm. [[R markdown](http://ethen8181.github.io/Business-Analytics/bayesian_statistics/MCMC/MCMC.html)]

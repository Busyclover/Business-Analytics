    "\n",
    "After defining the high level goal, find out (not guess) which parts of your business are underperforming or trending and why. Quantitative methods do a much better job answering how many and how much types of questions. Whereas qualitative methods such as User Experience Group (you go really deep with a few users. It can take form of observing users doing tasks or you ask users to self-document their behaviors) and surveys are much better suited for answering questions about why or how to fix a problem.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Segment by source:** Separate people who arrive on your website from e-mail campaigns, google, twitter, youtube, etc. Find answers to questions like: Is there a difference between bounce rates for those segments? Is there a difference in Visitor Loyalty between those who came from Youtube versus those who came from Twitter? What products do people who come from Youtube care about more than people who come from Google?\n",
    "- **Segment by behavior:** Focus on groups of people who have similar behaviors For example, you can separate out people who visit more than ten times a month versus those that visit only twice. Do these people look for products in different price ranges? Are they from different regions? Or separate people out by the products they purchase, by order size, by people who have signed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Youâ€™re looking at your metric of total active users over time and you see a spike in one of the timelines. After confirming that this is not caused by seasonal variation, we can look at different segment of our visitors to see if one of the segment is causing the spike. Suppose we have chosen segment to be geographic, it might just happen that weâ€™ve identify a large proportion of the traffic is generated by a specific region and it might be best for us to dig deeper and understand why.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Now that you've identify the overall business goal and the possible problem (e.g. Less than one percent of visitors sign up for our newsletter). It's time to prioritize your website goals. Three categories of goals include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do x: Add better product images.\n",
    "- Increase y: Increase click-through rates.\n",
    "- Reduce z: Reduce our shopping cart abandonment rate.\n",

    "**Define the Subject**\n",
    "\n",
    "What you need to do is to decide how to assign users to either the control or the experiment. Thereâ€™re three commonly used categories, namely user id, anonymous id (cookie) and event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **user id:** e.g. Log in user names. Choosing this as the proxy for your user means that all the events that corresponds to the same user id are either in the control or experiment group, regardless of whether that user is switching between a mobile phone or desktop. This also means that if the user has not log in then he / she will neither be assgined to a control or experiment group.\n",
    "- **anonymous id (cookie):** The cookie is specific for a browser and device, thus if the user switches from Chrome to Firefox, theyâ€™ll be assigned to a different cookie. Also note that users can clear the cookie, in which case the next time they visit the website theyâ€™ll get assigned to a new cookie even if theyâ€™re still using the same browser and device. For experiments that will be crossing the sign-in border, using cookie is preferred. e.g. Suppose youâ€™re changing the layout of the page or locations of the sign in bar then you should use a cookie.\n",
    "- **event:** Should only be used when youâ€™re testing a non-user-visible change. e.g. page load time. If not, what will happen is : The user will see the change when they first visit the page and after reloading the page, the user will not see the change, leading to confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the Population**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think you can identify which population of your users will be affected by your experiment, you might want to target your experiment to that traffic (e.g. changing features specific to one languageâ€™s users) so that the rest of the population wonâ€™t dilute the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, depending on the problem youâ€™re looking at, you might want to use a cohort instead of a population. A cohort makes much more sense than looking at the entire population when testing out learning effects, examining user retention or anything else that requires the users to be established for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note on cohort. The gist of cohort analysis is basically putting your customers into buckets so you can track their behaviours over a period of time. The term cohort stands for a group of customers grouped by the timeline (can be week, month) where they first made a purchase (can be a different action thatâ€™s valuable to the business). In a cohort, you can have roughly the same parameters in your two user group, which makes them more comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Youâ€™re an educational platform has an existing course thatâ€™s already up and running. Some of the students have completed the course, some of them are midway through and thereâ€™re students who have not yet started. If you want to change the structure of of one of the lessons to see if it improves the completion rate of the entire course and they started the experiment at time X. For students who have started before the experiment initiated they may have already finished the lesson already leading to the fact that they may not even see the change. So taking the whole population of students and running the experiment on them isnâ€™t what you want. Instead, you want to segment out the cohort, the group of customers, that started the lesson are the experiment was launched and split that into an experiment and control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the Size and Duration**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When do I want to run the experiment and for how long.**\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Suppose weâ€™ve chosen the goal to increase click-through rates, which is defined by the unique number of people who click the button versus the number of users who visited the page that the button was located. But to actually use the definition, weâ€™ll also have to address some other questions. Such as, if the same user visits the page once and comes back a week or two later, do we still only want to count that once? Thus weâ€™ll also need to specify a time period\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this, if 99% of your visitors convert after 1 week, then you should do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run your test for two weeks.\n",
    "- Include in the test only users who show up in the first week. If a user shows up on day 13, you have not given them enough time to convert (click-through).\n",
    "- At the end of the test, if a user who showed up on day 2 converts more than 7 days after he first arrived, he must be counted as a non-conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So one version of the fully-defined metric will be: For each week, the number of cookies that clicked divided by the number of cookies that interacted with the page (also add the population definition).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the test for a least a week is adviced since it'll make sure that the experiment captures the different user behaviour of weekdays, weekends. Try to avoid holidays ....\n",

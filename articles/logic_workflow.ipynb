    "# The Pyramid Approach For Presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the Pyramid Approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with the answer first.\n",
    "- Group and summarize your supporting arguments. \n",
    "- Then logically order your supporting ideas and create a storyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning that when an executive asked a question — \"What should we do?\" — you were to start your response with, “You should do X,” very crisply and directly. Only then, after you have answered the question, should you present your supporting reasons. Why? What's the benefit of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you maximize your time with your audience. Executives are busy people, they are perpetually short on time and get impatient when they feel like someone isn’t getting to the point. They want to focus on the big picture — in this case the \"answer\" — and may not want to get bogged down by details. In some cases, the executive may already mentally be at the conclusion you want them to reach, in which case she will accept your recommendation and move on (without you having to go into the detailed supporting arguments).\n",
    "- Second, Making a statement to your audience that tells them something (the answer) they don’t know, will automatically raise a question in their minds. Why? How? Is this true? Etc. The listener will more likely want to hear the supporting reasons to the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the flow will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Situation:** Starting with an illustration of the situation will establish a certain time and place for the listener. Preferably a time and place the listener can relate to. This should be a neutral description with facts that your listeners will agree upon. e.g. The company's market is mature and doesn't offer growth opportunity anymore.\n",
    "- **Complication:** The complication will illustrate a problem, thus creating a relevant issue. A certain sense of urgency or compelling reason to listen or even act. This is the desired change of the current solution e.g. The CEO would like to increase his profit by reducing his cost by 10%.\n",
    "- **Question:** The question that is results from the complication. The will also be the start of a question-answer dialogue. e.g. How can the company reduce its cost by 10%.\n",
    "- **Answer:** The question will be the main lead for your story and the answer your main topic.\n",
    "- **Supporting Arguments:** Underneath the single thought/answer, you are to group and summarize the next level of supporting ideas and arguments. You want to ensure that the ideas you bring together under each group actually belong together (at the same level of importance) and that all the possibilities has been covered.\n",
    "- **Create the StoryBoard:** Follow some logical structure. There are a few different ways of logically ordering the story: 1) Degree order: present supporting ideas in rank order of importance, most to least important. 2) Time order: if there is a sequence of events that form a cause-effect relationship, you should present the ideas in time order. e.g. Back to the how can the company reduce its cost by 10% question. The story is: We should outsource. Because competitor X is profitable, it has the same revenue as us but lower cost. Why? Because 50% of his core functions has been outsourced."

    "# Data Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "By telling a data story you're essentially walking the audience through a series of facts (can be shown through data visualization) that leads them to some sort a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the 7 most common data stories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change over time.** How are things before, how is it now and will it be in the future (trend).\n",
    "2. **Drill down.** Aggregrated value doeesn't tell the whole story e.g. Split down the measure geographically. You can start with a big picture and drill down to the nitty gritty details that see how the two differ. \n",
    "3. **Zoom out.** Simply the opposite of drilling down.\n",
    "4. **Contrast.** Comparying different or opposite things together. e.g. Comparing the maximum value of a measure and see where they appear geographically and then showing where the min value occured.\n",
    "5. **Intersection.** When does one value surpass the other, or vice versa. e.g. revenue of different product category.\n",
    "6. **Factors.** The data can tell you something that is true (a measure is decreasing over time), but often times that leads to another question, which is why. e.g. if we see some measures decreasing, we will surely want to figure out why. This is when breaking a metric that we're looking at down into different building blocks can help (factors that contributes to the metric). Note that, a lot of times the current data at hand won't be able to tell you the answer.\n",
    "7. **Outlier.** Boxplot can be useful here. Outliers can be very important message that tells you whether the data has quality issues."

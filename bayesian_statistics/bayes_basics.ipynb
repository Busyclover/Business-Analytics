    "# Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjoint probability** is a fancy way to say the probability that two things are true. If you learned about probability in the context of coin tosses and dice, you might have learned the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(A \\text{ and } B) = p(A)p(B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning if I toss two fair coins the probability of both coins end up being head is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula above only works when A and B are independent, meaning that the outcome of event A does not change the probability of the second, or more formally, $p(B|A) = p(B)$, where $p(B|A)$ denotes the probability of B given that A is true. A different example where the events are not independent would be, suppose A means that it rains today and B means that it rains tomorrow. Then if I know that it rains today, then it is more likely that it will rain tomorrow. So $p(B|A) > p(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus when the two events are not independent of one another, the formula above becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(A \\text{ and } B) = p(A)p(B|A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the chance of rain on any given day is 0.5, the chance of rain on two consecutive days is not 0.25, but probably a bit higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we know that the probabilities are symmetric (communutative), meaning that $p(A \\text{ and } B) = p(B \\text{ and } A)$. Hence we can put the pieces together that $p(A)p(B|A) = p(B)p(A|B)$. And if we divide both side with $p(B)$ that gives you the **Bayes's theorem:**\n",

    "$$p(A \\mid B) = \\frac{ p(A) \\, p(B \\mid A)  }{p(B)}$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "> Suppose there are two bowls of cookies. Bowl 1 contains 30 vanilla cookies and 10 chocolate cookies. Bowl 2 contains 20 of each. Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and without looking select a cookie at random. The cookie is vanilla. What is the probability that it came from Bowl 1? \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Bayes's theorem, this will get us $p(B_1 \\mid V) = \\frac{p(B_1)p(V \\mid B_1)}{p(V)}$. We know $p(B_1)$, the probability that we chose bowl 1 is 1/2; $p(V|B_1)$, the probability of getting a vanilla cookie from Bowl 1 is 3/4; $p(V)$, the probability of drawing a vanilla cookie from either bowl is 5/8 ( a total of 50 vanilla cookies in both bowl and a total of 80 cookies in both bowl ).\n",

    "## Diachronic Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way of looking at the Bayes's theorem is, it gives us a way to update the probability of a hypothesis $H$, in light of some body of data $D$. This is called the **diachronic interpretation**, where “diachronic” means that something is happening over time. Hence, this is equivalent to saying that the probability of the hypotheses changes over time, as we see new data. Given this information, we can now rewriting Bayes theorem with this new set of notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(H \\mid D) = \\frac{ p(H) \\, p(D \\mid H)  }{p(D)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p(H)$ is the probability of the hypothesis before we see the data, called the **prior probability**. Sometimes we can compute the prior based on background information. For example, the cookie problem specifies that there are only two hypotheses, the cookie either came from Bowl 1 or Bowl 2. In other cases the prior is subjective; that is, people might disagree. Either because they use different background information or because they interpret the same information differently.\n",
    "- $p(H|D$ is what we want to compute, the probability of the hypothesis after we see the data, called the **posterior probability**.\n",
    "- $p(D|H)$ is the probability of the data under the hypothesis, called the **likelihood**. This is usually the easiest part to compute.\n",
    "- $p(D)$ is the probability of the data under any hypothesis, called the **normalizing constant**. In the cookie problem, there are only two hypotheses. In that case we can compute $p(D)$ using the law of total probability, which says that if there are two exclusive ways that something might happen, you can add up the probabilities like this: $p(D) = p(B1) p(D|B1) + p(B2) p(D|B2)$. Plugging in the values from the cookie problem, we have\n",

    "M&M’s are small candy-coated chocolates that come in a variety of colors. Mars, Inc., which makes M&M’s, changes the mixture of colors from time to time. In 1995, they introduced blue M&M’s. Before then, the color mix in a bag of plain M&M’s was 30% Brown, 20% Yellow, 20% Red, 10% Green, 10% Orange, 10% Tan. Afterward it was 24% Blue , 20% Green, 16% Orange, 14% Yellow, 13% Red, 13% Brown.\n",

One is Yellow and one is Green. What is the probability that the Yellow one came from the 1994 bag?\n",

    "This is similar to the cookie problem, with the twist this time you'll be drawing one sample from each bowl/bag. This problem also gives us a chance to use the table method, which is useful for solving problems like this on paper. The first step is to enumerate the hypotheses.

    "So if you think a team has a 75% chance of winning, you would say that the odds in their favor are \"three to one\", because the chance of winning is three times the chance of losing. You can write odds in decimal form, but it is most common to write them as a ratio of integers. So \"three to one\" is written $3:1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When probabilities are low, it is more common to report the **odds against** rather than the odds in favor. For example, if you think your horse has a 10% chance of winning, you would say that the odds against are $9:1$."

    "\n",

If Oliver accounts for the common event, that leaves the rare event still unexplained. If Oliver doesn’t account for the \"O\" blood, then we have two chances to find someone in the population with \"AB\" blood. And that factor of two makes the difference."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Bayesians, there are two approaches to choosing prior distributions. Some recommend choosing the prior that best represents background information about the problem; in that case the prior is said to be informative. The problem with using an informative prior is that people might use different background information (or interpret it differently). So informative priors often seem subjective. The alternative is a so-called uninformative prior, which is intended to be as unrestricted as possible, in order to let the data speak for themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformative priors may seem a bit more appealing because they're more objective, but, people still favors the use of informative priors. Why? First, Bayesian analysis is always based on modeling decisions. Choosing the prior is one of those decisions, but it is not the only one, and it might not even be the most subjective. So even if an uninformative prior is more objective, the entire analysis is still subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for most practical problems, you are likely to be in one of two regimes: either you have a lot of data or not very much. **If you have a lot of data, the choice of the prior doesn’t matter very much**; informative and uninformative priors yield almost the same results. But if you don’t have much data, using relevant background information makes a big difference."
